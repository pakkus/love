            &emsp;&emsp;We met at Sopanam Hall on July 13, 2016, but actually didn't. We both were there at the same
            time for admission procedures. I have no clue who all were there then. By the circumstances, this was our
            first meeting.

            &emsp;&emsp;When all the girls in the class were denied to wear saries at Onam, she came in a Saree. We all
            thought she was a rebel, but actually she had to wear one for the 'Thiruvathirakali'. Later, she taught
            others how to wear one.

            &emsp;&emsp;Our class had great energy for mass bunks. We went to Aruvikuzhy Waterfalls in one of the
            massbunks. We had a great time there. Funny thing is that in the PTA meeting, these trips were mentioned to
            the parents. How did the teacher know about these are still a mystery.

            &emsp;&emsp;We went to IIM Kozhikode, since we were bored and also they had a free event. The hosting and

            how, but we got into the finals and secured 4th.

            vibing moments.

            &emsp;&emsp;Our frequent tripping location was NIT Calicut. Their fests was the best we got in the state.

            &emsp;&emsp;Food was always a weakness for us. Therefore, Cafes and Restaurants were our main "Romantic

            &emsp;&emsp;Our first major romantic trip was to Kochi. At first, I was little nervous about the same. We
            rented a scooty for the trip. It was really an astonishing trip, and at the same time fearful one. No one
            except us knew about this. We even had a minor accident. We visited most of the locations in Kochi. This
            trip would be an unforgettable memory.

            &emsp;&emsp;Industrial Visit was the main event we all excited while joining the campus. The All India trip, long train journeys, trekking, camping, river rafting, bike rides, and many more. The best part was I got to spend the whole trip with her. It was more of a couple's romantic trip rather than the class's IV. We got to taste different food items, played many games, time was well spent. Really wish to go again on such trips.
